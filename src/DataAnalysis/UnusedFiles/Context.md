# Context

## By Harry Clifford

During the creation of the project initially I had wanted to
have an interactive button list which allowed for the user to
view a cumulative frequency graph for individual assignments
as well as look at the overall for a specific module.

My attempts to do this took up a lot of my coding time but
sadly I couldn't solve it (although it is very close) by
the deadline of the module. I don't expect you to give this
section marks, but I'd appreciate you looking through it just
so that I feel as if I didn't waste a large amount of my
coding time. The cumulative frequency graph and formatting
for it work correctly as have been tested in an earlier version.
However, as I attempted to scrap together something to commit it
had to be dropped as I was struggling to get anything together
with the time remaining.

At the end of this file I'd like to put a personal apology to my
team for not providing them with the work that I wish I could have
and wish us all the best both in the marks for this module and any
future ones but also in whatever they end up doing as they are
all good people.
